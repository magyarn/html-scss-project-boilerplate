# html-scss-project-boilerplate
A starter-set of directories for working with HTML and SCSS

1. Make sure you have SCSS installed. Check by running `sass --version` in your terminal. If you get an error, run `npm install -g sass`.

2. Clone this repository by cd-ing to the directory where you want it to live on your machine, then run `git clone https://github.com/magyarn/html-scss-project-boilerplate.git`.

3. `cd` into the `html-scss-project-boilerplate` directory and start having SCSS watch for changes: run `sass --watch static/scss:static/css`

4. Have a sassy time! Many of the SCSS partial files contain comments for hints on how to use mixins, variables, media queries, and class extensions.
